              <p>Executive of Bon Appetit</p>
              <p>“When I first came to America from Canada, one of the first meals that I had was 
                American barbecue. Growing up in Canada, I had never had what is considered 
                traditional American style soul food. Over the years I have spent here, I have 
                developed my own spin on those first recipes that I tried”.</p>

              <h3>Chef Steve</h3>
              <p>Executive of Bon Appetit</p>
              <p>"This meal is inspired by my late grandmother. My grandmother adopted me at the age of 2. 
                For the 15 years that she raised me, every Friday she made a meal with fish. She always said 
                'no meat on Friday's'. This was my favorite fish meal and hopefully you will enjoy a part of 
                my childhood."</p>

              <p>Executive of Bon Appetit</p>
              <p>“Mindful eating is about being thoughtful, cooking and eating with awareness, not just for 
                the sake of eating. Eating local, seasonal, supporting sustainable fisheries, maintaining 
                healthy oceans, and sourcing from responsible farms that use minimal sprays, it's all 
                connected to the same idea. And it doesn't have to be hard. Takes a bit of time up front 
                but once you get in the groove and you know where to go it becomes part of a better, healthier lifestyle, not a chore.”</p>
